    <h2>Character Bio</h2>
    <p>Nightwing orginally known as the first Robin aka Boy Wonder, is a hero who is known to patrol Bludhaven and occasionally Gotham. He has his own 
    book series called <a href="https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Dick_Grayson">Nightwing</a> written by various authors but his most popular run is the 
    <a href="https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/comics/series/nightwing-2016/8ff8904e-90b2-47c2-9afa-502fe651aad7">Nightwing 2016</a>
    which is how I found out about the character all the way back in middle school. Overall Nightwing is a great DC character that has gone through many tribulations 
    that I believe gives him the spot of my favorite Superhero
